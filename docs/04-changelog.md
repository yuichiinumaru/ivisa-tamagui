# 04 – Changelog (VIVI Tamagui Design System)

All notable changes to this design system and its documentation will be recorded here.

## [Unreleased]
- Captured the new research-driven strategy for building a Tamagui-based design system in `docs/00-draft-new-research.md`.
- Created `docs/01-plan.md` to define the vision, methodologies, and phased roadmap for a "Frankenstein Controlado 100% Free" design system built on Tamagui, Bento Free, and headless libraries.
- Added `docs/02-tasks.md` as the primary task board, organizing work by phases (research, foundation, high-impact gaps, medium/low-effort components, web-specific UX, integration/handoff).
- Documented the design system architecture in `docs/03-architecture.md`, including theme/tokens, package layout (`packages/ui`), headless integration patterns, and reference repository strategy.

## [0.1.0] – Initial documentation pivot
- Archived the previous migration/automation-oriented project under `/old-port` for safekeeping.
- Reset the active `docs/` folder to focus solely on the new Tamagui-first design system direction.
- Confirmed that automation, agent orchestration, and rate-limiting concerns belong to other initiatives and are out of scope for this design system documentation.
