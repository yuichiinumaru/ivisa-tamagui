CONSOLE: startGroupCollapsed: [tamagui] Warning: missing token height in category size - $10 (open for details)
CONSOLE: info: Note: this could just be due to you not setting all the theme tokens Tamagui expects, which is harmless, but
                    it also often can be because you have a duplicated Tamagui in your bundle, which can cause tricky bugs.
CONSOLE: info: To see if you have duplicated dependencies, in Chrome DevTools hit CMD+P and type TamaguiProvider.
                    If you see both a .cjs and a .mjs entry, it's duplicated.
CONSOLE: info: You can debug that issue by opening the .mjs and .cjs files and setting a breakpoint at the top of each.
CONSOLE: info: We only log this warning one time as it's sometimes harmless, to disable this log entirely set process.env.TAMAGUI_DISABLE_MISSING_TOKEN_LOG=1.
