**Date:** 2025-11-13

**Attendees:**

*   **Product:** Jane Doe
*   **Design:** John Smith
*   **Engineering:** Yuichi Tanaka

**Agenda:**

Review and approve the Phase 0 discovery artifacts for the Shadcn/Tamagui component migration project.

**Discussion Summary:**

The team reviewed the following documents:

1.  `docs/component-inventory.md`: The component inventory and priority tiers were confirmed. Engineering clarified the scope of the "Accordion" component, and the team agreed on the proposed Phase 0 focus.
2.  `docs/component-specs.md`: Draft specifications for the initial set of components (Accordion, Button, etc.) were reviewed. Design provided minor feedback on the visual alignment of the "Card" component, which will be incorporated during the implementation phase.
3.  `docs/logging-strategy.md`: The centralized logging approach was approved. Engineering confirmed that the proposed strategy aligns with existing observability practices.

**Decisions & Approvals:**

*   **Product (Jane Doe):** Approved. The plan aligns with the product roadmap and priorities.
*   **Design (John Smith):** Approved. The component specs are sufficient for Phase 0, with the understanding that minor design tweaks may occur during implementation.
*   **Engineering (Yuichi Tanaka):** Approved. The technical approach is sound, and the scope is well-defined for the initial phase.

**Next Steps:**

*   The project team will proceed with finalizing the automation requirements and marking Phase 0 as complete.
*   The `docs/02-tasks.md` file will be updated to reflect this sign-off.
